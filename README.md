1. Sort claims by date: The algorithm sorts all the claims by their date (either encounter date or submission date, depending on the insurer's preference).
2. Group claims by date and insurer: The algorithm groups the sorted claims by their date and insurer.
3. Check daily capacity: For each group of claims, the algorithm checks if the total monetary value of the claims exceeds the insurer's daily capacity.
4. Create batches: If the total monetary value exceeds the daily capacity, the algorithm creates a new batch for the excess claims. Otherwise, it adds the claims to an existing batch.
5. Repeat the process: The algorithm repeats the process for each group of claims until all claims have been assigned to a batch.
